  <h3>Where and how can I use Licensed Images?</h3>
  <p>
You are allowed to use Images in connection with the Pic-Diary site for which you like them. However, purchasing a Licensed Image under these Image Terms does not convey any ownership rights in the underlying Licensed Images, and your usage rights are limited to only what is described here.</p><br><br>
  <h3>Where and how can I use watermarked images?</h3>
  <p>Watermarked images are provided for private use only, so that you can get a feel for how an image would look on one of your pages. You cannot otherwise use any watermarked images. Notably, that means you cannot display them on public sites, or otherwise share them with others.</p>
